# Hull Repairs

Allow host to repair the ship with `!repair`.

**Note**: Host still pays for repairs and the ship must be in the repair bay with the shields down.

## Motivation

I made this out of frustration while playing the below 30% hull meta and trying to repair my ship fifty points at a time.
